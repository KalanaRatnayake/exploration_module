# Exploration Module

This module recognizes unexplored areas by taking the octomap generated by the octomap framework, position of the robot and the dimensions of the area to be explored as inputs and returns the most suitable location to be explored as the output. This is accomplished by analyzing the environment for unexplored regions and selecting a suitable region for exploration.
